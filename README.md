## Project Statement
- February Report [Here](https://github.com/ragarwa7/WolfPal/blob/master/Reports/team-k_wolfpal_feb_report.pdf)

We propose a system to propose a prospective graduate plan for a new student for enrolling into a new semester and helping increase communication between relevant peers for the courses. There is a lot of information available online which can help student make a well informed decision but this information is sparsely present. Due to the scattered presence,this information is sometimes hard to find which makes it ineffective. Additionally,  the  students  prefer  to  communicate with their peer who have information about a course.According to our survey, this technique was used by most ofthe students. The students also reported that sometimes itis hard to find peers with knowledge about a particular subject.  Also, the information about the events and activitiesare available on university’s website but still students do notknow about it due to scattered presence of every availablething.  In this paper, we propose a solution of tackling thesetwo problems - lack of information and lack of communication.

## Steps to Run App

1. Sign up for using the application.
2. Interact with the bot to begin your plan evaluation. 
3. Choose the graduate track which interest you. 
4. Choose the courses which interest you. An appropriate graduate plan will be suggested to you based on these choices. 
5. Choose the graduate plan that suits you most perfectly. 
6. Once your courses are finalized, you have the option to open the unique forum for a specific course, as well as a forum which is completely general. You can access different elements of the forum using keywords pertaining to a specific topic.
